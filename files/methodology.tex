\section{Algorithm}

This will be the basic algorithm for the book suggestion:

\noindent

Step 2: Something Something\\
Step 3: Another thing you do\\
Step 4: End

% It is better to put double backslash (\) on above than creating new paragraph.

\section{System Overview}
What technologies you are gonna use? Like programming language, database servers, frontend, backend, all sorts of stuffs.

Better use subsection.

% Usage:
% \subsection*{TOPIC_NAME}
%
% Remove the % infront and change the TOPIC_NAME to what you want to describe like, if its PHP, use:
% \subsection*{PHP} and on next line start describing a bit about it.
% The * after subsection means it will not show up in table of contents.
% If you want to show it in table of contents, remove *, duh.


\section{Testing and Debugging Tools}

These are the list of tools that we will use for testing and debugging our programs.

Use subsection as above for better formatting.


\section{Cost Estimation}


The cost estimation of the project is as follows:

\begin{table}[h!]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | m{0.1\textwidth} | m{0.7\textwidth}| m{0.2\textwidth} | } 
\hline
1& Proposal Printing & NPR 100  \\ 
\hline
2& Report with Hard Copy Binding & NPR 800 \\ 
\hline
3& Miscellanous & NPR 100 \\
