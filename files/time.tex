\section{Gantt Chart}

% Hello everyone, I spent a day making this chart and finding what went wrong when xcolor gave weird errors, so don't say its ugly okay, thanks.

% Search for gantt chart examples if you want something else.
% You can customize it if you want, learn yourself.
% PS: Most Documentation on internet are outdated and won't compile.
% This one works btw. I tried it. I worked on it so hard.

    title height = 1,
    bar top shift = 1, %to move it inside the grid space ;)
