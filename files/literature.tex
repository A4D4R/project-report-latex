\section{Significance of Study}

The main purpose of your project. What will it achieve? Describe here, better write it on bullets (lists). Use 
\begin{itemize}

\item First Item

\item Second Item

\end{itemize}


\section{Related Works}

Is your project unique on its own? Probably not. Describe about other projects similar to yours and how you are different from them (on how you are better, not how you are worse than older works)
